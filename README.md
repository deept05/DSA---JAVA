# DSA USING JAVA

This repository contains practice implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java. It covers foundational programming tasks such as calculating factorials and summing natural numbers, and extends to more complex topics including array and string manipulations, loops, searching and sorting algorithms, and pattern problems. The aim is to reinforce DSA concepts and improve problem-solving skills through hands-on practice.

# Contributing
Feedback and suggestions are welcome to help improve the repository.

# Acknowledgments
Thanks to the resources and tutorials that supported the development of these implementations.
